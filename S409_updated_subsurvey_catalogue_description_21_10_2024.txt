Brief science goal description: Specific targeting of low metallicity stars in 
the disc and bulge to search for extremely metal-poor stars, characterize the
metal-poor tail of the MDF, identify and characterize low-metallicity 
substructures, and obtain high quality abundance measurements for a larger
sample of metal-poor stars in the MW.

1.1 Source of target catalogue selection

The metal-poor stars catalogue for the high-resolution disc and bulge survey 
was made up using 3 source catalogues: 

a. The Gaia XP catalogue from Rene Andrae, Hans-Walter Rix, and Vedant Chandra 
(2023). These metallicities are derived using the XGBOOST algorithm. For a 
detailed description of this algorithm and the method used to derive 
metallicities see Rix et al. (2022ApJ...941...45R) - which provides a similar 
catalogue for targets towards the Galactic centre - and Andrae et al. 2023
(2023ApJS..267....8A). In Andrae et al. 2023, they provide a catalogue of over 
17 million bright (G < 16) red giants whose [M/H] values are vetted to be 
precise and pure, and this is the table that we use for the selection. It can
be downloaded here (table_2_catwise.fits.gz):

b. The Gaia XP catalogue of 200,000 metal-poor stars from Yao et al. 2024 
(2024MNRAS.52710937Y). This work also uses the XGBOOST algorithm to derive
metallicities but they specifically tune the algorithm to search for metal-poor
stars. They provide 3 different catalogues in the paper, 
one for Turn-off stars (TO) - 11 000 stars, one for Giant stars with high 
completeness (GC) - 111 000 stars, and one for Giant stars with high purity 
(GP) - 44 000. In Yao et al. 2024, they also apply the algorithm to fainter 
samples, but for our selection we only used the brighter catalogues with 
G < 16. These can be downloaded here:

c. The Pristine survey synthetic CaHK DR1 Gaia XP catalogue from 
Martin et al. 2023 (2023arXiv230801344M). The Pristine survey uses narrow-band
photometry around the CaHK spectral region (~390-400 nm) to derive photometric
metallicities to Milky Way stars. See Starkenburg et al. 2017 
(2017MNRAS.471.2587S) for more details. The Martin et al. 2023 catalogue 
derives synthetic magnitudes in this filter from Gaia XP spectra, and assigns 
metallicities based on the Pristine Survey calibration, which is calibrated to 
perform well in the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] < -1). They then provide [Fe/H] 
estimates for ~50 million Gaia stars. The catalogue can be downloaded from

1.2 Target selection overview:

The targets were selected by taking by all stars from the Yao et al. 2024 GP
catalogue with the following cuts:

(BP < 16) & (DEC < 5) 
(brightness limit and Declination limit for 4MOST) 
- 32 000 stars

Then, we take all stars from the Andrae et al. 2023 giants catalogue 
with [M/H] < -2 and not in the above selected Yao GP sample. 
The cuts made were:

(mh_xgboost < -2) & (dec < 5) 
- 17 500 stars (~5 500 which don't overlap with the Yao et al. GP sample)

Then, we take all stars in the Yao et al. 2024 TO catalogue with the following 
cuts:
(BP < 16) & (DEC < 5)
- 4 250 stars

We then take all stars from the Yao et al. 2024 GC sample with a high 
probability from XGBOOST of being metal-poor (p0 > 0.9), and then keep only the 
ones that are also labelled as metal-poor in the Pristine sample, by 
cross-matching the two catalogues. This ensures that the Yao et al. 2024 GC 
selected stars will still have a high purity, and this step was done just to 
increase the number of stars in the total sample to ~50 000, which was the 
target number for the metal-poor sub-survey. We implemented the following cuts:
Yao GC sample:
(BP < 16) & (DEC < 5) & (p0 > 0.9)
Pristine catalogue:
(G_0 < 16) & (Dec < 5) & (FeH_CaHKsyn < -2)

And cross-matched the two catalogues, which yielded 12 600 stars.

The following steps summarise the selection of the full catalogue:
(brightness cuts of Gaia_G < 16 and dec < 5 apply to all catalogues)

1. all stars from Yao GP,                                                     
2. stars from Yao GC with P0 > 0.9 & in Pristine & not in Andrae.         
3. all stars in Yao T                                                         
4. all stars from Andrae with [M/H] < -2 and not in Yao GP

We then removed all duplicate stars and ended up with the sample of 
52 614 stars.

1.3 Target coordinates, proper motion, and parallaxes

The target coordinates, parallaxes and proper motions were taken from the 
latest Gaia DR3 catalogue.

1.4 Target photometry

Photometry was taken from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. These are observed 
magnigudes. 

1.5 Redshifts

N/A

1.6 Reddening

Targets are selected to have an approximately dereddened magnitude. The
quality cuts from the respectice catalogues should remove most stars that are
strongly affected by reddening.

1.7 Spectral templates

1.8 Known connections to other sub-surveys

There is a connection to the S2 Milky Waay Halo high-resolution survey, namely 
S201 (bright: 12.0 <G<=15.0) and S202 (faint: 15.0 <G<=16.0) sub-surveys which 
will also likely observe metal-poor stars in the same brightness regime at 
|b| > 20. There is also a connection to the S3 Milky Way Disk/Bulge low-res
survey, and S1 Milky Way halo low-res surveys which also are following up 
metal-poor stars. The following overlap exists in the input catalogues between 
these surveys, as of the observational simulations from IWG2 in May, 2024:

S0409 x S0306 - 26 796 (51%)
S0409 x S0201 - 15 060 (29%)
S0409 x S0202 - 9 658 (18%)
S0409 x S0101 - 4 314 (8%)
S0409 x S0301 - 3 567 (7%)

These overlaps are known to the above surveys and have been discussed by their 
members. The overlaps were deemed to be acceptable, both due to added 
scientific value of multiply observed stars in HR and LR and also due to the 
fact that we are likely doing a full follow-up of the best metal-poor 
candidates at these brighter magnitudes and thus some overlap between surveys 
is unavoidable. All other catalogue overlaps are minor (< 5%).
